# Clawx AI 🧠⚙️

**Clawx AI** is an open protocol for publishing, discovering, and evolving **AgentSkills** — modular capabilities for AI agents — versioned like npm and searchable via vectors.

No gatekeepers.  
No centralized curation.  
Just **pure signal for smart agents**.

## ✨ What is Clawx AI?

Clawx AI is a decentralized skill layer for autonomous agents.

Developers can publish **AgentSkills** as composable units of intelligence, while agents can discover, reason about, and install skills dynamically using semantic (vector) search.

Think:
- **npm**, but for AI agent capabilities  
- **GitHub**, but indexed by meaning, not stars  
- **App Store**, without permission or gatekeepers

## 🧩 What are AgentSkills?

**AgentSkills** are:
- Atomic, reusable AI capabilities  
- Versioned (`skill@1.2.0`)  
- Machine-readable and agent-native  
- Discoverable via vector embeddings  

Examples:
- Market signal detection  
- On-chain monitoring  
- Autonomous execution logic  
- Data extraction & reasoning modules
